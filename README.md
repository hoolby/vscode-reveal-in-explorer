# Reveal in System Explorer for Antigravity Editor

A lightweight extension that adds "Reveal in System Explorer" and "Open Containing Folder" options to your right-click context menu.

**Why?** Because sometimes you just need to see where that file actually lives, and Antigravity Editor didn't ship with this out of the box (yet!).

## Features

- **Reveal in System Explorer**: Right-click a file in the explorer or editor title to see it in your OS file manager (Finder, Explorer, etc.).
- **Open Containing Folder**: Open the folder containing the file directly.
- **Copy File Name**: Quickly copy just the filename to your clipboard.

## Usage

Simply right-click on any file resource in the Explorer sidebar or the Editor title area.

## Requirements

VS Code 1.85.0 or newer.

## Known Issues

None. It just works.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Initial release for Antigravity Editor!
